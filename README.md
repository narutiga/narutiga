# Hi there! I'm Kino🐾

Although I'm new to programming, I find learning it extremely enjoyable.
I’m diligently studying every day to pursue a career change into software engineering. My main focus is on JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, and I'm interested in both front-end and back-end development. （While I'm naturally curious about infrastructure as well, unfortunately, I don't have the capacity for that just yet.）

If you find my profile even slightly interesting, please feel free to reach out! I'd love to connect and learn from you.
